scenario_options
  To see available scenario options type: pwrtest.exe /scenario /?
  Example: pwrtest.exe /sleep /?

common_options
  /lf:folder         folder for the log files
                     For example, c:\myfolder or \\server\share
                     Default log location is the same folder as pwrtest.exe
  /ln:name           name for the log files and the ETW trace session name.
                     Log file extensions added automatically (.wtl, .xml, etc.)
                     Default name is pwrtestlog.
  /etwbuffersize:n   n indicates ETW buffer size in KB if larger than default.
                     Default is current page size or 256KB (whichever is
                     greater).
  /etwminbuffers:n   n indicates the minimum number of buffers allocated for
                     the ETW session if larger than the minimum of 2 per
                     logical processor.
                     Default is 2 per logical processor
  /etwmaxbuffers:n   n indicates the maximum number of buffers allocated for
                     the ETW session if larger than the minimum of 2 per
                     logical processor and larger than etwminbuffers.
                     Default is etwminbuffers + 20.
  /delaywrite        when specified, log data is buffered in memory to reduce 
                     disk writes.  Affects all log types including ETL.


Execution Requirements:
  -must run from an administrator/elevated command prompt in order to support
   ETW tracing
  -must run natively (WoW64 not supported) in order to support ETW tracing
  -group policy settings put in place by your system administrator may
   interfere with some scenarios that need to temporarily modify power
   setting values (such as the sleep scenario)
